<p>Hello, my name is Kayla Bell! Welcome to my website. I'm a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison majoring in Journalism and Political Science with a certificate in Digital Studies and a graduation date of May 2023. Over the years I've developed a love for storytelling and community, which have led me to my interest in documentary filmmaking. Throughout much of my past and present journalistic adventures, I've accumulated a variety of skills which have refined and shaped me into the journalist I am today; reporting; writing; editing; podcasting; social media; design; photography; you name it and I've probably done it. I hope to use my wide-encompassing skillset to guide me in my journalistic pathway to becoming a documentarist. As a creatively focused individual with an equally analytical mind, I'm eager to use these skills to bring a unique and original outlook to the journalism world post-graduation. As you navigate through my site, you will gain a more in-depth look into who I am both within the world of journalism and outside it as well. This includes a look into my work as an amateur photographer, a variety of the publications I've written for and the articles that go along with them, and, outside of the realm of my journalistic adventures, the hobbies and interests I often partake in.</p>
